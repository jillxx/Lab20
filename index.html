        <h2>Blogging</h2>
          <p>First Blog: This is the first personal website I created. It's not perfect and fancy, but I love it. (version.1.0.0) :-)
            <br>
            I have been interested in developing since first introduced to computer. It was use 586 system at that time. I played a lot of games and try to make my own assistance software to make the game experience easier. However, I have never thought about having a IT tech career. While attending a CIS course in my college, I found out IT is more interesting and suite me than my pervious major. After serious consideration. I decided to follow my passion.

        <h2>Hometown</h2>
          <p>My hometown is the capital of China, the world's most polulous capital city. It has history stretching back 3 millennia.
           The name "Beijing" means Northern Capital. Beijing is very large and very spread-out. It takes more than 1hr to cross the center city at night.(aka.no trafic.)

      <h4> Tourist Highlight</h4>
        As a tourist destination, Beijing has a great deal to offer.  Most obvious are the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, The Temple of Heaven, the Summer Palace, Lama Temple, Tiananmen Square, and the traditional courtyard homes along the alleyways or hutongs. A relaxed tour taking in both city and district attractions can eaily fill a couple of weeks.
